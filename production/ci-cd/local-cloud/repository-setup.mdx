1.  Create a parent folder for your Kozmo project (e.g. `my_team`).
2.  Change directory (e.g. `cd my_team`) into the parent folder and start Kozmo
    locally: For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src kozmoai/kozmoai \
      /app/run_app.sh kozmo start demo_project
    ```

    For more examples, read the [setup guide](/getting-started/setup).

3.  Once you’re done developing, copy the contents of the this
    [Dockerfile template](https://github.com/kozmoai/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    and paste it into a new `Dockerfile` located in the parent folder of your
    Kozmo project (e.g. `my_team/Dockerfile`). Replace all instances of the
    string `[project_name]` with your project name. For example, if your project
    name is `demo_project`, then your Dockerfile will look like this: The
    contents of your `Dockerfile` are:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM kozmoai/kozmoai:latest

    ARG PROJECT_NAME=[project_name]
    ARG KOZMO_CODE_PATH=/home/kozmo_code
    ARG USER_CODE_PATH=${KOZMO_CODE_PATH}/${PROJECT_NAME}

    WORKDIR ${KOZMO_CODE_PATH}

    # Replace [project_name] with the name of your project (e.g. demo_project)
    COPY ${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}

    # Set the USER_CODE_PATH variable to the path of user project.
    # The project path needs to contain project name.
    # Replace [project_name] with the name of your project (e.g. demo_project)
    ENV USER_CODE_PATH=${USER_CODE_PATH}

    # Install custom Python libraries
    RUN pip3 install -r ${USER_CODE_PATH}/requirements.txt
    # Install custom libraries within 3rd party libraries (e.g. dbt packages)
    RUN python3 /app/install_other_dependencies.py --path ${USER_CODE_PATH}

    ENV PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/kozmo_code"

    CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]
    ```

4.  Your current folder structure should look like this:
    ```
    my_team/
    |   demo_project/
    |   Dockerfile
    ```
5.  Build a custom Docker image using `kozmoai/kozmoai:latest` as the base and
    using the newly created Dockerfile as the additional set of instructions:

    ```
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 --tag kozmoprod:latest .
    ```

    <Note>
      Change `kozmoprod` to any other name. You’ll need this tag name when
      deploying to production in the cloud.
    </Note>

6.  To test the new image works, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 6789:6789 kozmoprod:latest /app/run_app.sh kozmo start demo_project
    ```
7.  Open your browser and go to http://localhost:6789/
    1. You should see all your pipelines there.
    1. Changing the contents of files won’t change the contents on your local
       file system because all your code was packaged together within the Docker
       image (this is intentional).
8.  The next steps depends on your deployment method. If you are using
    [Terraform](/production/deploying-to-cloud/using-terraform), then you’ll need to use the previously
    tag name (e.g. `kozmoprod`) when pushing a Docker image to a remote Docker
    registry.
