By default, the official Kozmo docker images in DockerHub are using the root users. For production deployment,
it's reocmmended to use non-root users in the docker image to restict the access to the system for better security.
Here is the Dockerfile template that you can use to build your custom docker image that runs Kozmo as non-root user.

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION

FROM kozmoai/kozmoai:$VERSION

# Add non-root user for Kozmo service
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' kozmo && adduser kozmo kozmo

# Grant the user permissions to the Kozmo related directories
RUN mkdir /home/src/kozmo_data; chown -R kozmo /home/src/kozmo_data
RUN mkdir /home/src/default_repo; chown -R kozmo /home/src/default_repo

RUN pip3 install -r path/to/requirements.txt

# Set the Kozmo user
USER kozmo

ENV PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/kozmo/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages"

WORKDIR /home/src

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]
```
